A signup page where Doctors, Therapists, and Patients can register. After registration, Patients select a Doctor and provide details about their injury or disease. Upon login, Doctors see new patient assignments, assign a Therapist, and create patient reports. Therapists, upon logging in, view their assigned patients and generate reports. Doctors review Therapist reports, assign medications, and finalize patient reports. Patients can view both Doctor and Therapist reports, along with the prescribed medications.
